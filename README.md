# InnovationProject2022
Repository for a prototype of a morning butler app.

To run the prototype app, either:
1. run nogui.py
2. run gui.py

Make sure you have all the other files in the same directory, and installed the appropriate
python libraries.
Also remember to enter you own API key to openWeather and Google API, in the method apiRequests in main.py.
